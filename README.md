# Project Proposal

### Project title
Manga Bookshelf- digital bookshelf and rating forum for manga 

### What and why?
We aim to create a digital manga bookshelf that organizes and categorizes mangas into ones you have read, are currently reading, and wish to read. The core purpose of this platform is not only to keep a tab on manga series but also to help users continuously discover new ones. To facilitate this, we have incorporated a forum where users can rank and discuss their favorite manga. This way, members can quickly find and add top-rated mangas to their personal shelves.

One of the driving forces behind this project is the experience of avid manga readers. Many of us often follow manga series that are ongoing. Consequently, it becomes a challenge to keep track of all the series, especially when waiting for new releases. Additionally, the internet presents a scattered scenario where manga rankings, discussions, and reading platforms exist in different spaces. Our website aims to centralize this experience, making it significantly more streamlined and user-friendly for all manga enthusiasts, or "weebs".

### For whom?

This website is for those avid manga readers (poeple like me) who wants to keep on reading but also at the same time keep a good record of what I am reading and what I and others think of them. 

### How?
Ideally, the website should have the following functions:
1. Provide links to actual manga reading websites.
2. Store a record of all the manga the user has read and checked.
3. Track the latest chapter a user has read.
4. Notify users when a new chapter of a manga they're following is released.
5. Allow users to rate, comment on, and rank manga (both on a personal scale and based on overall community rankings).
6. Offer the ability to follow specific authors.
7. Allow users to follow particular readers/commentators.
8. Enable users to set their manga library to public or private. This will allow users to follow others with similar reading lists, providing recommendations based on shared interests.


### Scope
This website will rely on open source manga reading websites, and MyAnaimeList's ranking. Since we are building from the ground up, I think there is a good amount of work to be done for a group of 4-6 programmers.
