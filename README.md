# Project Proposal

### Project title
Manga Bookshelf- digital bookshelf and rating forum for manga 

### What and why?
We aim to create a digital manga bookshelf that organizes and categorizes mangas into ones you have read, are currently reading, and wish to read. The core purpose of this platform is not only to keep a tab on manga series but also to help users continuously discover new ones. To facilitate this, we have incorporated a forum where users can rank and discuss their favorite manga. This way, members can quickly find and add top-rated mangas to their personal shelves.

One of the driving forces behind this project is the experience of avid manga readers. Many of us often follow manga series that are ongoing. Consequently, it becomes a challenge to keep track of all the series, especially when waiting for new releases. Additionally, the internet presents a scattered scenario where manga rankings, discussions, and reading platforms exist in different spaces. Our website aims to centralize this experience, making it significantly more streamlined and user-friendly for all manga enthusiasts, or "weebs".

### For whom?

This website is for those avid manga readers (poeple like me) who wants to keep on reading but also at the same time keep a good record of what I am reading and what I and others think of them. 

### How?
Ideally, the website should have the following functions:
1. Provide links to actual manga reading websites.
2. Store a record of all the manga the user has read and checked.
3. Track the latest chapter a user has read.
4. Notify users when a new chapter of a manga they're following is released.
5. Allow users to rate, comment on, and rank manga (both on a personal scale and based on overall community rankings).
6. Offer the ability to follow specific authors.
7. Allow users to follow particular readers/commentators.
8. Enable users to set their manga library to public or private. This will allow users to follow others with similar reading lists, providing recommendations based on shared interests.


### Scope
This website will rely on open source manga reading websites, and MyAnaimeList's ranking. Since we are building from the ground up, I think there is a good amount of work to be done for a group of 4-6 programmers.

### Project title
Self Mental Health Check-in

### What and why?
"Self Mental Health Check-In" is a digital mental health companion designed to offer real-time support to individuals navigating their emotional and mental wellbeing. With the increasing acknowledgment of mental health issues and the stigma around them slowly diminishing, we feel thereâ€™s a need for immediate, intuitive, and personalized tools to assist individuals.


### For whom?

Primarily designed for college students or anyone experiencing any degrees of stress.

### How?
Ideally, the website should have the following functions:
1. Daily Mood Logging: Users log their daily mood, selecting from options like happy, sad, anxious, etc., and can add voice notes or text.
2. Resource Links: Based on the logged mood, the app suggests resources, such as a grounding meditation for anxiety.
3. Support Circle:  Users add trusted contacts to share moods and daily activities.
4. Professional Directory: A searchable database of therapists and helplines, with booking and telehealth options.
5. Crisis Mode: For moments of extreme distress (e.g. a ), a prominently displayed crisis mode can be activated, connecting users immediately to helplines or sending alerts to the support circle.
6. Journals: A private space for users to pen down their thoughts or experiences.
7. Playlists: Curated playlists of calming music, nature sounds, or guided meditations.


### Scope
As there are multiple features to implement while each feature is not that complicated, I would say that it is a reasonable amount of wrok for a group of 4-6 people to complete in one semester.

# Project Proposal 3

### Project title
Route Discoverer

### What and why?
Route Discover is a web application designed to help individuals discover various types of trails outside their homes. Whether that be going from restaurant to restaurant or taking a hike. The App will allow the user to customize their experience, to discover new routes to explore, and share their finding with others, facilitating connections and the spirit of adventure. 


### For whom?

Designed for people who want to go out and discover new things to do. 

### How?
Ideally, the website should have the following functions:
1. A short list to gauge the user's interests (including a preset of options) 
2. Discover new routes: Main feature of the App, using something like google maps api to generate routes will be a good start
3. Record and share your routes with other people on the platform 
4. Real-time tracking to make sure you are going the right way (updates on the events going on in the nearby area) 
5. Routes are saved and user can provide a rating of the route after they are done 
6. any transit information included (car, bike, walk, etc)
7. For hikes or bike rides also keep track of information on your progress (average speed, mph, etc)


### Scope
There are multiple parts of the app but the most important part is the generation of new routes. It's quite a bit to implement and might require more than one platforms (or use a cross-platform tool like flutter/dart)

# Project Proposal 4

### Project title

StuTracker

### What and why?

This is a centralized app that incorporates multiple tools for teachers, 
parents, and students to monitor and track academic progress comprehensively. In the increasingly digital world of education, having a centralized 
platform for monitoring student performance and engagement is crucial. This system is important because it can improve educational outcomes, 
enhance communication between teachers, parents, and students, and provide valuable insights into student development.

### For whom?

StuTracker is primarly designed for K-12 educational institutions, including public and private schools. The primary users include teachers, parents, and students.

### How?

StuTracker will offer several features. The functionality of StuTracker will be based off of these different features. These include:

Student Profiles: Each student will have a profile with their personal information, attendance history, and academic records.

Grading System: Teachers can input and update grades for assignments, quizzes, and exams. The system will calculate cumulative grades and provide graphical representations of student performance.

Attendance Tracking: Teachers can take attendance in real-time, and parents can access attendance records for their children.

Communication Hub: An integrated messaging system for communication between teachers, parents, and students. This system will also send automated notifications about important events, grades, and attendance. Think of it like Discord or like Microsoft Teams.

Progress Reports: Generate detailed progress reports that provide insights into a student's academic journey, including strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.

Goal Setting: Students and teachers can collaboratively set academic and behavioral goals, with progress tracked over time.

### Scope

The proposed project is suitable for a group of approximately 4 - 6 programmers to complete in one semester. The base of the project goes around the main website, and then adding the separate features. If all features are too difficult to fit within a semester, we can cut down the amount of features in the website or modify it (simplify).
