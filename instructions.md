# Project Proposal

Write a proposal for a software product you would like to pursue for the majority of the semester. Make it obvious, interesting, and make the need for it sound convincing.

## Collaboration

You are welcome to write a proposal with up to 5 other students, if desired. If you do work with others on the proposal, you **must** clearly indicate the names of all the team members in your proposal.

## What to include

Your proposal must focus on the product's value proposition, including answers to the questions below. Keep it thorough but concise. If you are not clear on whether your writing is any good, consult with a friend.

### Project title
Manga Bookshelf- digital bookshelf and rating forum for manga 

### What and why?
We aim to create a digital manga bookshelf that organizes and categorizes mangas into ones you have read, are currently reading, and wish to read. The core purpose of this platform is not only to keep a tab on manga series but also to help users continuously discover new ones. To facilitate this, we have incorporated a forum where users can rank and discuss their favorite manga. This way, members can quickly find and add top-rated mangas to their personal shelves.

One of the driving forces behind this project is the experience of avid manga readers. Many of us often follow manga series that are ongoing. Consequently, it becomes a challenge to keep track of all the series, especially when waiting for new releases. Additionally, the internet presents a scattered scenario where manga rankings, discussions, and reading platforms exist in different spaces. Our website aims to centralize this experience, making it significantly more streamlined and user-friendly for all manga enthusiasts, or "weebs".

### For whom?

This website is for those avid manga readers (poeple like me) who wants to keep on reading but also at the same time keep a good record of what I am reading and what I and others think of them. 

### How?
Ideally, the website should have the following functions:
1. Provide links to actual manga reading websites.
2. Store a record of all the manga the user has read and checked.
3. Track the latest chapter a user has read.
4. Notify users when a new chapter of a manga they're following is released.
5. Allow users to rate, comment on, and rank manga (both on a personal scale and based on overall community rankings).
6. Offer the ability to follow specific authors.
7. Allow users to follow particular readers/commentators.
8. Enable users to set their manga library to public or private. This will allow users to follow others with similar reading lists, providing recommendations based on shared interests.


### Scope
This website will rely on open source manga reading websites, and MyAnaimeList's ranking. Since we are building from the ground up, I think there is a good amount of work to be done for a group of 4-6 programmers. 

## Submission

Complete the assignment as a Markdown document in the file named `README.md` in this repository. The message should be nicely formatted and outlined with a clear heading and sub-headings for each section.

Use the `git` features of **Visual Studio Code** to commit your work and `push` them to the GitHub repository.

Share the link to your document in your private assignments Discord channel AND in the public #project-ideas channel. In both cases, include the title of your project for all to see in the message.

## What happens next

We will select a subset of the proposals that we think will be the most interesting and appropriate for this course. These will be published to the class. Your next assignment will be to rank your favorites. We will then make team assignments based on this information and the answers you have provided to the previous introductory questionnaire.

If your proposal is selected, you are 99% guaranteed to be part of that team.
