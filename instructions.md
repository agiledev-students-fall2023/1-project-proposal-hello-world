# Project Proposal

Write a proposal for a software product you would like to pursue for the majority of the semester. Make it obvious, interesting, and make the need for it sound convincing.

## Collaboration

You are welcome to write a proposal with up to 5 other students, if desired. If you do work with others on the proposal, you **must** clearly indicate the names of all the team members in your proposal.

## What to include

Your proposal must focus on the product's value proposition, including answers to the questions below. Keep it thorough but concise. If you are not clear on whether your writing is any good, consult with a friend.

### Project title

Give your project a nice title.
Manga Bookshelf- digital bookshelf and rating forum for manga 

### What and why?

What software system would you like to build this semester, and why? Include a description of what problem the system would solve and why this is important.

We aim to create a digital manga bookshelf that organizes and categorizes mangas into ones you have read, are currently reading, and wish to read. The core purpose of this platform is not only to keep a tab on manga series but also to help users continuously discover new ones. To facilitate this, we have incorporated a forum where users can rank and discuss their favorite manga. This way, members can quickly find and add top-rated mangas to their personal shelves.

One of the driving forces behind this project is the experience of avid manga readers. Many of us often follow manga series that are ongoing. Consequently, it becomes a challenge to keep track of all the series, especially when waiting for new releases. Additionally, the internet presents a scattered scenario where manga rankings, discussions, and reading platforms exist in different spaces. Our website aims to centralize this experience, making it significantly more streamlined and user-friendly for all manga enthusiasts, or "weebs".

### For whom?

Who will this software be for? These people are your end-users or customers.

Do not make software for imaginary users who do not exist - you must have real people as your initial end-users. Tell us who they are. For example, is it for a particular type of business, mass consumer, a campus office, a professor, or friends or family, or ... people just like you.

Understanding who your end-users are, and ideally speaking with some along the way, will help you refine your designs to be suitable for your audience, and understand whether you have succeeded at the end or not.

This website is for those avid manga readers (poeple like me) who wants to keep on reading but also at the same time keep a good record of what I am reading and what I and others think of them. 

### How?

A description of what the system will do from an end-user's perspective. Be as complete as necessary to fully explain the system, but do not worry about technical implementation - this will be developed in subsequent work.

Ideally, the website should have the following functions:
1. all the links to the actual manga reading websites 
2. stores all the mangas the user has read and checked. 
3. stores/know what chapter that the user has last read. 
4. notify if there is a new chapter of the manga that the user has read. 
5. able to give ratings, comments, and rankings(personal ranking and everyone's ranking). 
6. able to follow to specific authors 
7. able to follow specific reader/commentator 
8. can share/make manga library public or private so that user can follow whoever has a similar book list as you so you can follow/read whatever is in their list. 

### Scope

A brief justification that the proposal is neither too easy nor too ambitions for a group of approximately 4 - 6 programmers to undertake in one semester.

This website will rely on open source manga reading websites, and MyAnaimeList's ranking. Since we are building from the ground up, I think there is a good amount of work to be done for a group of 4-6 programmers. 

## Submission

Complete the assignment as a Markdown document in the file named `README.md` in this repository. The message should be nicely formatted and outlined with a clear heading and sub-headings for each section.

Use the `git` features of **Visual Studio Code** to commit your work and `push` them to the GitHub repository.

Share the link to your document in your private assignments Discord channel AND in the public #project-ideas channel. In both cases, include the title of your project for all to see in the message.

## What happens next

We will select a subset of the proposals that we think will be the most interesting and appropriate for this course. These will be published to the class. Your next assignment will be to rank your favorites. We will then make team assignments based on this information and the answers you have provided to the previous introductory questionnaire.

If your proposal is selected, you are 99% guaranteed to be part of that team.
